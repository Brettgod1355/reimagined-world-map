 * NPC pictures from our map server, for the search panels and cards of both maps: scaled once to the two sizes shown
 * and kept. A label waiting for a picture gets it when it comes, so no list is built again for it. A label asks only
 * once it is painted, so the rows of a long list cost nothing until scrolled to, and a few are asked for at a time:
 * a row scrolled past before its turn waits until it is painted again. Swing thread.
